# Box Challenge - 


## [Joshua Moore](mailto:joshua.moore@leudla.net)
Draws boxes either stacked horizontally or vertically, nested inside of each other.

To run the examples, run ./bin/box.js examples/*
Or choose a specific example.
Or pass in a string via the command line, just be sure to escape your characters using single quotes. 


  Usage: `./bin/box.js '[ [] ]'`
  Don't forget to escape your characters as appropriate for your shell if
  using this from the command line. 

  Welcome to Joshua Moore's implementation of the box challenge. This program
  draws nested ASCII boxes. Here's a quick rundown of the language used for 
  controlling box.js...

  For a single box, enter: 
  * `[]` to get

```
    +-+
    | |
    +-+
```

  You can nest boxes by including one in another.
  * `[ [] ]`

```
    +-----+
    | +-+ |
    | | | |
    | +-+ |
    +-----+
```

  The syntax for controlling stacking behavior is pretty literal:
  * `[- [] [] ]`, including a minus - after the opening box tag stacks boxes
    horizontally.
  
  ```
    +---------+
    | +-+ +-+ |
    | | | | | |
    | +-+ +-+ |
    +---------+
```

  * `[| [] [] ]`, while a pipe will stack a box's children vertically

```
    +-----+
    | +-+ |
    | | | |
    | +-+ |
    | +-+ |
    | | | |
    | +-+ |
    +-----+
```


  * Of course, writing out all the boxes by hand can get cumbersome, so here's
    some shortcuts: 

    `[-2[]]` will produce two horizontally stacked children
    `[|5[]]` will produce five vertically stacked children

    Please note that numbers can only be used inside of other boxes.


  * You can mix and match number and literal syntax:

   `[- 2[] [|5[]] [-3[]] ]` will produce 

```
    +---------------------------------+
    | +-+ +-+ +-----+ +-------------+ |
    | | | | | | +-+ | | +-+ +-+ +-+ | |
    | +-+ +-+ | | | | | | | | | | | | |
    |         | +-+ | | +-+ +-+ +-+ | |
    |         | +-+ | +-------------+ |
    |         | | | |                 |
    |         | +-+ |                 |
    |         | +-+ |                 |
    |         | | | |                 |
    |         | +-+ |                 |
    |         | +-+ |                 |
    |         | | | |                 |
    |         | +-+ |                 |
    |         | +-+ |                 |
    |         | | | |                 |
    |         | +-+ |                 |
    |         +-----+                 |
    +---------------------------------+
```

  * And finally, there's a shortcut for nesting boxes

    `./bin/box.js '[- 2[^5] 3[]]'`

```

    | +-+ +-+ +-----------------+ +-+ +-+ +-+ |
    | | | | | | +-------------+ | | | | | | | |
    | +-+ +-+ | | +---------+ | | +-+ +-+ +-+ |
    |         | | | +-----+ | | |             |
    |         | | | | +-+ | | | |             |
    |         | | | | | | | | | |             |
    |         | | | | +-+ | | | |             |
    |         | | | +-----+ | | |             |
    |         | | +---------+ | |             |
    |         | +-------------+ |             |
    |         +-----------------+             |
    +-----------------------------------------+
```

    Enjoy!
