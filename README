# Box Kernel

## Setup

I am no build engineer...

### Box Runtime

The standalone Box runtime can be installed like so:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/box-lang/box
$ cd box
$ npm install
# npm link
```

This is all you need to get going writing beautiful boxes. 

### Box Kernel

If you're feeling adventurous, you can install the jupyter kernel that goes along
with it.

#### From Source

```sh
$ Install Jupyter
$ python -m venv jupyter
$ source jupyter/bin/activate
$ python -m pip install jupyter jupyterlab

# Install box-kernel
$ git clone https://github.com/box-lang/box-kernel
$ cd box-kernel
$ python -m pip install -e box_kernel
$ python -m box_kernel.install
```
